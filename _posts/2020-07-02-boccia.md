Boccia Champions was a project developed during the 3rd year of University as part of the Professional Project module. 
It was worked on as a team with multiple disciplines, consisting of a producer, a designer, three artists, a sound engineer and two programmers.

The project was a collaboration with CHAS to develop a game simulating the sport of Boccia. The game focused on accessibility as it 
was aiming to be playable for everyone in CHAS' Rachel House.

The game features two teams playing against each other - there's no networking involved, instead players can 
rotate between one input device or connect multiple such as keyboard or controllers.
One players throw the "jack" (a white ball), after that it's each player's goal to throw their balls as close to the jack as they can.
After the round ends (when each player throws 5 balls), the player gains points for each ball closer to the jack than the opponent's.
After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.

My responsibilities in the team involved setting up the main game scene - placing objects and models, as well as most of 
the code related to the game mechanics such as collision detection, ball throwing mechanics, a path system which would predict the flight 
of the ball based on how hard it was to be thrown, and more.

The game was also entered into the International Serious Play Awards for students, where it managed to earn the Bronze Award.
