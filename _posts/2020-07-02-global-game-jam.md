For the 2020 Global Game Jam, I worked with a designer and a producer, but unfortuantely we were not able to find any artists
and decided to work on a board game instead. This allowed me to work on something completely new, and allowed me to experience
more of a designer role as I worked with the other members on figuring out the game rules and the game balance.

The game board is made up of cardboard tiles which are placed in a rectangle shape, with an additional tiles placed
on each side of the rectangle. The goal of the game is for players to work together to transport all animals placed 
randomly on the tiles to a designated "animal sanctuary" tile. They need to do this before the "fire" engulfs the animals. 

The game features a resources system, which consists of wood, stone and water. Water can be used to extinguish a tile which
is on fire, whereas stone and wood are necessary to build up the "animal sanctuary" before the animals can be safely
placed there.
