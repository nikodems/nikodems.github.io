For the AI Module in Year 3 I worked on a small game to showcase the difference between two AI techniques: rule-based and fuzzy systems.

The player controls the pink bar in the middle, by moving it left or right. Meanwhile the green and blue rectangles will try to follow the bar's movements. The blue bar uses a rule-based system, which are a bunch of if statements
that modify the velocity based on the distance to the bar. The fuzzy rules follow a similar principle but instead of concrete numbers for the distance it uses generalizations such as very far, quite far etc. In the end, the fuzzy 
system performs better when the bar is further away while the rule-based system performs better when the bar is closer to the rectangles.

A library called FuzzyLite was used to retrieve values from the fuzzy system created in MATLAB.
