For this game jam organized by the Duxford Imperial War Museum I worked together in a team with three other artists, a designer
and a producer. The theme for this game jam was to create an old school / retro, educational game. The team chose to 
work on a game based on the museum itself, with the purpose being to supplement the exploration of the actual museum.

The game begins at the map of the museum, where players can choose to click on the buildings to head there (only the bottom
building was implemented.) This puts them into the plane display, where they can click on any of the planes to learn more
about them. Players can also play the mini game from here, the goal of which is to drop bombs onto tanks.
